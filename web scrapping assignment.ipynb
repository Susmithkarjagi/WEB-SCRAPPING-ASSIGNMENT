    "Regular expressions: This involves using a series of patterns and symbols to match and extract specific data from the HTML code of a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping Libraries: There are several libraries available for different programming languages, such as Python, Java, and Ruby, that provide functions and methods for web scraping. Some popular libraries include BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs: Some websites provide an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows developers to access and retrieve data from their website in a structured format. This method is more reliable and efficient than traditional web scraping methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Headless Browsers: A headless browser is a web browser that operates without a graphical user interface (GUI). This approach allows developers to automate web browsing and scraping tasks, including filling out forms, clicking links, and extracting data. Some popular headless browsers include PhantomJS and Puppeteer.\n",
